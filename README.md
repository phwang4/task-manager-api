# task-manager-api

Created with Andrew Mead's Udemy Node.js course. 

Initialize with npm init to download all the necessary libraries.
Then, create a folder called config and a file inside called dev.env

Inside that file, you will need the following variables which are to be referenced in the code:
PORT=
SENDGRID_API_KEY=
JWT_SECRET=
MONGODB_URL=

I used PORT=3000 when testing, an api key given by sendgrid, a secret passcode for JWT, and a local mongoDB url.
